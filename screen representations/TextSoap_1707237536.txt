Mobile task automation is an attractive technique that aims
to enable voice-based hands-free user interaction with smart-
phones. However, existing approaches suffer from poor scala-
bility due to the limited language understanding ability and
the non-trivial manual efforts required from developers or end-
users. The recent advance of large language models (LLMs)
in language understanding and reasoning inspires us to re-
think the problem from a model-centric perspective, where
task preparation, comprehension, and execution are handled
by a unified language model. In this work, we introduce Auto-
Droid, a mobile task automation system that can handle arbi-
trary tasks on any Android application without manual efforts.
The key insight is to combine the commonsense knowledge
of LLMs and domain-specific knowledge of apps through
automated dynamic analysis. The main components include a
functionality-aware UI representation method that bridges the
UI with the LLM, exploration-based memory injection tech-
niques that augment the app-specific domain knowledge of
LLM, and a multi-granularity query optimization module that
reduces the cost of model inference. We integrate AutoDroid
with off-the-shelf LLMs including online GPT-4/GPT-3.5 and
on-device Vicuna, and evaluate its performance on a new
benchmark for memory-augmented Android task automation
with 158 common tasks. The results demonstrated that Auto-
Droid is able to precisely generate actions with an accuracy
of 90.9%, and complete tasks with a success rate of 71.3%,
outperforming the GPT-4-powered baselines by 36.4% and
39.7%. The demo, benchmark suites, and source code of
AutoDroid will be released at https://autodroid-sys.github.io/' at position (0, 194).
